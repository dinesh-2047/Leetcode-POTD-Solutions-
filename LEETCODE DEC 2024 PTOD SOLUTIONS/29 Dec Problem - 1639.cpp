/*
Time Complexity:
- The function `solve` is called with parameters (i, j) representing the index in the target and the index in the word. 
- There are at most `k` (length of target) recursive calls for `i`, and at most `m` (length of words) recursive calls for `j`, making the time complexity O(k * m).
- Each state is computed once due to memoization in the dp table, so the time complexity is O(k * m).

Space Complexity:
- We store the `freq` matrix, which is of size 26 x m (26 for each character of the alphabet, and m for the columns in the words), giving a space complexity of O(26 * m) â‰ˆ O(m).
- The `dp` table is of size k x m, giving a space complexity of O(k * m).
- Thus, the total space complexity is O(k * m).
